cha0s--thanks for all the WiiremoteJ help, could not have done it without you.

Emmanuel Puybaret, author of Sweet Home 3d and this tip:

http://lists.apple.com/archives/java-dev/2007/Sep/msg00023.html

for the tip and for your time and help, and for the example of SweetHome3D, 
thanks so much. In the true spirit of open source development, you have 
given me solutions to a lot of problems. 

Arnar Birgisson, Ronald Oussoren, Ian Johnson, and the gang on the PyObjC list--
thanks for all the help. Sorry the Python version didn't work out. I still love 
Python, but Java has more mature apis. At some point I had to choose between
an exercise in learning Python and delivering something in a timeframe compatible
with my level of patience.

Shorty, for jumping in and making the first draft of actual pants, thanks a lot.

Mae, for refining and developing the garment, and contributing your bellydancing 
expertise.

Leonard J. Paul, for his valuable article in Gamasutra:

Helped me make the Pure Data piece 'Just Work.' Very important.

Hardoff, from the Pure Data forums, for your assistance and patience with my stupid
questions.
 
If there's anyone else I have missed here, don't be shy about raising your voice--
I know this has required help from more folks than this, and I want to 
acknowledge you too.
