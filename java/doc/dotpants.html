	<h1>the .pants file</h1>
	<p>Boogiepants is an unusual program. But in one sense it is quite ordinary: much like Microsoft Word (though probably more like PowerPoint) it displays and edits documents. These documents are called .pants files.</p>
	<p>Each .pants file contains groups of instruments. When you push buttons on the wiimote, it switches between those groups. Each button has its own group.</p>
	<p>When you start boogiepants, or you choose File > New from the menu, you are given an empty file. You can enter edit mode by choosing Edit > Edit Mode from the menu. You can tell if you are in edit mode by the  text 'edit mode' in the corner of the screen. You can tell which instrument set you are editing by the symbol that appears, matching the most recent button you've pushed on the wii remote.</p>
	<p>And much like any other application, you can save and reload .pants files in the same way you do elsewhere.</p>
	<a name="editing"/>
	<h2>editing instruments</h2>
	<p>you can add, edit, and delete all the different kinds of instruments. Here's how.</p>
	<h3>editing strike instruments</h3>
	<p>From the menu, choose Edit > Add Strike Instrument.</p>
 	<p>If you haven't imported any shapes, the Import Shapes dialog comes up first. Choose a file that contains a 3-d shape from your computer, with the .obj extension. The /boogiepants directory that comes with the application has a few geometric ones, in the /resources/geometry subdirectory.</p>
	<p>Next comes a screen that allows you to choose three things: the shape for this instrument, the color of that shape, and the <a href="mediacontrolOSC.html">OSC address</a> it should use. Fill it in and click 'create.'</p>
	<p>If you look carefully, the shape you picked should appear imbedded in the end of the stick. If you use the up and down arrows, the shape will move up and down the stick. Position the mouse over the display window. Choose a location for the instrument with the stick, and click the mouse. Note it now moves with the the instruments instead of the stick.<p>
	<p>If you don't like its location, point the stick at the instrument again and press down the mouse button. Move to your desired location, and release the mouse button, and it is moved.</p>
	<h4>importing shapes</h4>
	<p>You can import various 3D shapes to use with strike instruments. Use File > Import Shapes. Once you've imported a shape, it can be used with any strike instrument.</p>
	<p>Boogiepants uses .obj files. You can find them on the Internet, or make your own, using <a href="http://www.blender.org/" target="_top">Blender</a>, <a href="http://www.artofillusion.org/" target="_top">Art of Illusion</a>, <a href="http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/index?siteID=123112&id=7635018" target="_top">Maya</a>, or a number of other 3D modeling software packages.
	<h3>editing scale instruments</h3>
	<p>When you choose Edit > Add Scale Instrument, you get a dialog that lets you enter an <a href="mediacontrolOSC.html">OSC address</a>.  Fill it in and click 'create.'</p>
	<p>Next, you should see a little blue ball protruding from the end of the stick. Position the same way you do with a strike instrument.<p>
	<p>Next, you should see a little red ball protruding from the end of the stick. Position the same way you do with a strike instrument.<p>
	<h3>creating pelvic circle instruments</h3>
	<p>When you choose Edit > Add Pelvic Circle Instrument, you get a dialog that lets you choose a color and enter an <a href="mediacontrolOSC.html">OSC address</a>.  Fill it in and click 'create.'</p>
	<h3>creating toggle instruments</h3>
	<p>When you choose Edit > Add Toggle Instrument, you get a dialog that lets you choose a color and enter an <a href="mediacontrolOSC.html">OSC address</a>.  Fill it in and click 'create.'</p>
	<h3>deleting instruments</h3>
	<p>Point the stick at an instrument, and press the mouse down as though you were going to move it. Then hit the 'delete' key. For pelvic circle and toggle instruments, do this with the cone shape at the bottom.</p>
