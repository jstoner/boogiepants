<P>Please remember, this is proof-of-concept software. That means it works well enough to be interesting. 
That's not the same as working well. It may be balky and clunky and throw the occasional exception. That's ok.
If you run into anything you can't resolve with the instructions here, just let us know.</p>

<P> If you try to pair with the wii remote and you fail, try again. You may have to shut the remote off first.</p>

<p> if you are running the Pure Data patch (found at /pd/oscserv.pd), and you can't get a sound out of it, go
to the Pure Data console, and click the checkbox next to 'compute audio.' If it's already checked, click it twice.</P>
