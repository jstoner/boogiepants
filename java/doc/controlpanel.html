	<h1>the boogiepants control panel</h1>
	<p>When you start boogiepants you see this control panel:</p>
	<p><img src="images/controlpanel1.png"/></p>
	<p>The only active control is the 'connect to wii remote' button. After you connect, you see this:
	<p><img src="images/controlpanel2.png"/></p>
	<p>The rest of the controls are now active. </p>
	<p>The <b>'center boogiepants position'</b> button  allows you to establish a neutral position, irrespective of the position of your wiimote and nunchuk on your body. We recommend using it immediately after establishing a connection:</p>
	<ol>
	<li>first, assume a relaxed neutral posture. You will need to have your mouse within arm's reach;</li>
	<li>then click the button.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>This establishes your body's neutral posture as the boogiepants neutral position, with the stick straight up and down.</p>
	<p><b>The slider on the left controls sensitivity.</b> Different performers have different levels of pelvic flexibility; we recommend playing around with different levels of sensitivity, to get a feel for what's comfortable for you. </p>
	<ul>
	<li>as you slide the slider up, the stick and the instruments will move more with your body. So if you lift your hip, the angle of the stick will move higher, the higher the slider goes. </li>
	</ul>
