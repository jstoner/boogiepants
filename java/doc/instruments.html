	<h1>the instruments and the stick</h1>
	<p>This is easier to see than explain. There are two things in boogiepants: the stick, which moves with the pelvis, and the instruments, which move with the core of the body. The stick interacts with the instruments in different ways, depending on the kind of instruments.</p>
	<p>As you click buttons on the wiimote, new sets of instruments appear for you to interact with. Don't worry if no instruments appear. You can <a href="dotpants.html">get new sets from .pants files, and you can create your own .pants files</a>.
