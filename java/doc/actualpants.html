	<h1>the actual pants</h1>
	<p>A design for the garment that holds the wii remote will be available on an open-source basis, much like the boogiepants code. It will be linked from these instructions when it becomes available. You will be able to make your own, or even start a business making them and sell them to others, if you like.</p>

	<h2>design considerations for the  garment</h2>
	<p>You can also design your own boogiepants garment. Bear in mind, boogiepants is just a silly name. The garment doesn't necessarily need to qualify as pants. It just needs to do these things:</p>
	<ul type="circle">
		<li><b>Locate the nunchuk somewhere on the pelvis.</b> The front of the hip seems most responsive so far, but further experimentation may be needed;</li>
		<li><b>Locate the wii remote somewhere on the torso, probably above the belly.</b> This allows you to move the two independently. Shorter dancers may need to locate it higher up on their torsos.</li>
		<li><b>Allow the dancer to access the buttons on the wiimote during performance.</b> You can put it in a pocket with strategically placed holes, or make it out of tight, sheer fabric. Just don't make it so tight the buttons get pushed accidentally.</li>
		<li><b>Keep the sensors in place during a performance.</b> We want to measure the motion of the dancer's body, not the flopping of the dancer's clothing. The garment will need to be form-fitting. At the same time, we don't want the garment to slide around too much.</li>
		<li><b>Allow the wii remote and nunchuk to be removed and replaced easily.</b> Batteries need to be replaced, and the garment may need to be washed at some point. Don't put your wiimote in the wash.</li>
		<li><b>It's important that the wiimote go into its pocket from the left, and the buttons point out from the torso,</b> both for interaction with the software and ease of interaction for the dancer. </li>
		<li><b>It's important that the nunchuk go into its pocket from the top (pointing down), and that the joystick points towards the front of the body.</b>  
		<li><b>All boogiepants garments should be stylish and fun.</b></li>
	</ul>
