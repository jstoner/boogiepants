	<h1>setting up boogiepants for a performance</h1>

	<p>To use boogiepants in a performance, you need a few things: </p>
	
	<ul>
	<li>a stage with a blank wall or screen suitable for projection;</li>
	<li>a computer to run boogiepants on--a laptop works well. It needs to support bluetooth, and reasonably fast graphics;</li>
	<li><a href="actualpants.html">actual pants</a>--the garment that holds the motion sensors on your body;</li>
	<li>a wiimote and nunchuk;</li>
	<li>a projector to show the boogiepants display to the audience;</li>
	<li>a display you can use to see boogiepants during your performance (assuming you will face the audience, and the projected display will appear behind you, you will need to have a display in front of you. Or you could rehearse a lot.) Again, a laptop works well, something like a teleprompter or heads-up display might be ideal. We would need to experiment with that;</li>
	<li>something to put the display on, like a stool.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>One feature useful for performance is full screen mode. Select View > Full Screen to go into full screen mode, and use pretzel-F to toggle back and forth.</p>
	<p>It's also useful to set up your operating system to display the same image on both screens. On the Mac:</p>
	<ol>
	<li>Connect your projector;</li>
	<li>go into System Preferences > Displays. Click Detect Displays if necessary;</li>
	</ol>
